               Every man's heart one day beats its final beat. His lungs breathe their final breath.

                I know you've all heard talk of being the emperor's chosen and heroes of the Imperium, but the truth is, you are essentially nothing to this Imperium. You're farmers, workers, and criminals, picked to be a part of the most expendable force known to man. You will be sent into battle. You will be sent often. Many of you will die, and you will die often. I do not expect you to like it, but I am asking that you accept this and make your peace with it.

              Why is religious Christmas imagery all so joyful and pleasant? where is the inherent horror of the birth of Christ? A mother is handed her newborn child, wailing and innocent. Her hands come away sticky. Red. Simply by giving her son life she has already killed him. He is doomed from the beginning. Her love will not save him from suffering. Because the thing cradled in her arms is not a baby, it is a sacrifice: born amongst the other bleating animals whose blood will one day be spilled in the name of what demands it. the night is silent with anticipation. Mary, did you know? That your womb was also a grave? <br> <b>-noknowshame-</b>
